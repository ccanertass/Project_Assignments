# BlockFall - A Console-Based Tile-Matching Game


## Introduction
BlockFall is a console-based tile-matching game inspired by Tetris. Players must strategically position falling blocks within a grid to clear full rows and maximize their score. The game implements core computer science concepts, including:
- **Linked Lists**
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- **Matrices**

This project is part of the **BBM203 Software Practicum I** course.

## Features
- **Classic Mode**: Play with traditional block mechanics.
- **Block Rotation & Movement**: Move blocks left, right, rotate clockwise, or counterclockwise.
- **Leaderboard**: Saves top 10 high scores with timestamps.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficient use of linked lists for storing blocks and scores.
