<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    This project does not include input files, making it difficult to run directly. This limitation exists because the project was designed for automatic grading in the <strong>BBM203</strong> course.
</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
    This assignment is a <strong>C++ programming task</strong> that focuses on arrays, matrices, and basic image processing concepts. The primary objective is to implement various image processing techniques while handling:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>File input/output operations</li>
    <li>Memory allocation</li>
    <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Concept: Convolution</h3>
<p>
    One of the main concepts in this assignment is <strong>convolution</strong>, a mathematical operation widely used in image processing.
    Convolution is performed by applying filters (kernels) to an image to extract or enhance specific features. The operation involves
    sliding a kernel matrix over the input image and computing the sum of element-wise multiplications.
